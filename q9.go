/**
 * Create a simple stack which can hold a fixed number of ints.
 * It does not have to grow beyond this limit.
 * Define push – put something on the stack – and pop – retrieve something from the stack – functions.
 * The stack should be a LIFO (last in, first out) stack.
 *
 * Bonus: write a String method which converts the stach to a string representation.
 * This way you can print the stack using: `fmt.Printf("My stach %v'n", stack)`.
 * A stack could be represented: [0:m] [1:l] [2:k]
